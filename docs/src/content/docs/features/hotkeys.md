> These hotkeys work globally—meaning they are accessible from anywhere in your system.

## Typing Out Clipboard Content

Clippy supports typing out the clipboard contents as simulated keystrokes—a useful feature in environments where direct pasting is restricted.

- **Trigger**: `Ctrl + B`
- **Use Case**: Secure login fields, remote desktop inputs, terminal-based applications.

## Customization

Clippy allows you to:

- Rebind any hotkey to suit your preferences.
- Disable or override conflicting shortcuts.
- Assign shortcuts to additional features like sync or encryption toggle.

Navigate to `Settings > Hotkeys` within Clippy to customize bindings.

## Tips

- Use `R`, `T`, and `H` to quickly filter your clipboard history by relevance.
- Favor frequently used snippets with `F` and access them instantly with `T`.
- Press `P` regularly to sync your history with the cloud (if enabled).
