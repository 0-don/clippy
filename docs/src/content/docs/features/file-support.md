description: A quick guide to Clippy's file clipboard support.
---

Clippy doesn't just manage text and images â€” it also supports clipboard entries that contain **files**. Whether you're copying documents, folders, or other file-based content, Clippy keeps your files organized, secure, and easily accessible.

## What File Support Includes

- **File Clipboard History**: Clippy automatically stores recently copied files in your clipboard history.
- **Metadata Display**: View file name, type, size, and timestamp in the history list.
- **Quick Actions**: Open file location, re-copy to clipboard, or favorite the file for later use.

## Visual Representation

Files are shown in the clipboard history with icons and details for easy recognition. Here's how it might look:

## File Handling Settings

Clippy offers several options for how file clipboard entries are handled:

| Option                     | Description                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Enable File Support**    | Toggle file tracking on or off             |
| **Max File Size**          | Limit which files are stored based on size |
| **File Type Filters**      | Search for a specific file extension       |
| **Cloud Sync Integration** | Optionally sync file entries               |

## Security and Privacy

- **End-to-End Encryption**: If encryption is enabled, both file paths and associated metadata are encrypted locally before storage or sync.
- **Customizable Exclusions**: You can define sensitive file types or paths to be excluded from tracking entirely.
- **Secure by Design**: File access is sandboxed and follows strict permission boundaries. Clippy never modifies your original files.
